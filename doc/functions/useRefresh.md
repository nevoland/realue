# Function: useRefresh()

> **useRefresh**(): `RefreshResult`

Returns a function that triggers a refresh of the element.

The returned function has a `value` property set to the `boolean` value that toggles between `true` and `false` to trigger the refresh. This is useful if, in addition to a refresh, the dependencies of a hook need to be refreshed as well.

## Returns

`RefreshResult`

A function that triggers a refresh, with the `value` property.
